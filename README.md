# py_wraps_data_types

A lightweight, foundational Python package providing core data structures and extended types for wrapper ecosystems. 

Currently, this package provides the `Variant` type: a highly optimized, "duck-typed" Enum designed to reduce boilerplate when validating raw strings at API boundaries.

## Installation

You can install this package using `pip` or `uv`:

```bash
pip install py_wraps_data_types
# or
uv add py_wraps_data_types
